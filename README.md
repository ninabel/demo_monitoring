# Device Monitoring Demo

The core domain object is a **Site**. 

Each Site has several **Devices** (batteries, inverters, PV panels, wind turbines …). 

Device reports at least one **metric** (e.g. battery state‑of‑charge, PV power, wind speed). 

Devices belong to **Device Types**, which determine which metrics can be measured on given device.
